Macro Recorder
=============
------------------------------------------
Latest Version: [v.1.1.1][releases]

A simple and lightweight global mouse and keyboard recorder and player. The recordings log the time between actions to simulate realistic playback when playing a recording. 

Mouse clicks and keystrokes are recorded as presses and releases, allowing simulation of dragging the mouse or holding down a key. This allows for commands that involve a combination of keys.
